# wlan-autoroam

An automated Wi-Fi roaming analyzer with agentic AI capabilities. Test your wireless network's roaming performance across access points with detailed phase-by-phase metrics and AI-powered analysis.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **AI Features Require Your Own API Key**: RoamBot needs an LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, or local Ollama/LM Studio). Basic roaming tests work without AI. See the [AI analysis section](#ai-analysis-roambot) for configuration.

## Features

* **ðŸ¤– Agentic AI Assistant (RoamBot)** - Natural language interface with autonomous tool usage. Ask questions, run tests, compare networks, and get insights without manual data wrangling. Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, or local LLMs (Ollama/LM Studio).
* **Mobility Score** - Easy-to-read score to evaluate your roaming readiness ([learn more](docs/MOBILITY_SCORE.md)).
* **Multi-Run Analysis** - AI can autonomously fetch and compare multiple test runs, track performance trends, and identify patterns across networks.
* **Interactive Web UI** - Modern interface with real-time test execution, AI chat, and result management.
* **Automatic AP Selection** - Intelligently sequences roams based on RSSI, security type, and network configuration.
* **Phase Timing Breakout** - Measures duration for auth, reassoc, EAP, and 4-way handshake from the client perspective.
* **Failed Roam Diagnostics** - Auto-saves log snippets for failed roams with detailed error context.
* **Save/Load Results** - Persist test runs with notes for historical comparison and trend analysis.
* **MCP Integration** - Model Context Protocol server for AI agent interactions ([learn more](docs/MCP_EXPLAINER.md)).
* **REST API** - Programmatic access to all test and analysis functions.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**System Requirements:**
- Linux (Debian/Ubuntu or similar)
- Active Wi-Fi connection
- Root/sudo access (required for wireless tools: `iw`, `wpa_cli`)

**Your system needs:**
- `wpa_supplicant` and `wpa_cli`
- `iw` (wireless tools)
- `journalctl` (systemd)
- `ip` (iproute2)

Most modern Linux distributions have these installed by default.

### Installation

1. **Download the binary** from the [latest release](../../releases/latest)

2. **Make it executable:**
   ```bash
   # Replace * with the version for your binary (i.e. wlan-autoroam-amd64)
   chmod +x wlan-autoroam-*
   ```

3. **Run the setup wizard:**
   ```bash
   # Replace * with the version for your binary (i.e. wlan-autoroam-amd64)
   sudo ./wlan-autoroam-*
   ```

   On first run, the wizard will:
   - Check for required system utilities
   - Detect your wireless interface(s)
   - Prompt for web UI username and password
   - Generate secure configuration files
   - Launch the web UI at https://localhost:8443

4. **Access the web interface:**
   - Open https://localhost:8443
   - Login with your configured credentials
   - Accept the self-signed certificate warning (or provide your own certs)

That's it! See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for your first roaming test.

### Configuration Files

After setup, your configuration lives in:
- **Config**: `~/.config/wlan-autoroam/`
  - `.env` - Web UI credentials
  - `user_prefs.json` - Default interface and RSSI threshold
  - `certs/` - SSL certificates (replaceable)
  - `ai_settings.json` - AI provider configuration (via web UI)

- **Data**: `~/.local/share/wlan-autoroam/`
  - `runs/` - Test results and saved runs
  - `roam.log` - Application logs

See [BINARY_USAGE.md](BINARY_USAGE.md) for detailed configuration options.

## AI Analysis (RoamBot)

RoamBot is an agentic AI assistant that can run tests, analyze results, compare networks, and answer questions about your Wi-Fi infrastructure. It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to access tools and data autonomously.

**What makes it "agentic"?** RoamBot decides which actions to take based on your question. Ask to "run a test and compare it to yesterday's run" - it'll start the test, wait for completion, fetch the historical data, and provide a comparison. No button clicking required.

> [!TIP]
> In my testing Claude Haiku 4.5 (Anthropic) has been best for price/performance. The MCP implementation makes is easy to swap out models so experiment to find what works best for you. To easily try different public models, check out OpenRouter. Local LLMs via Ollama like Qwen3 do work but YMMV.

### Setup

1. Click **AI Settings** (top bar icon) and configure your provider:
   - **OpenAI**: Get API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys. Endpoint: `https://api.openai.com/v1`.
   - **Anthropic**: Get API key from https://console.anthropic.com/. Endpoint: `https://api.anthropic.com/v1`.
   - **OpenRouter** (multi-model): Get API key from https://openrouter.ai/. Endpoint: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`. Supports Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and 200+ models.
   - **Ollama** (local): Install with `curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh`, pull a model (`ollama pull llama3.2`), set endpoint to `http://localhost:11434/v1`.
   - **LM Studio** (local): Download from https://lmstudio.ai/, start the server, set endpoint to `http://localhost:1234/v1`.

2. Save settings and start chatting. RoamBot will introduce itself.

**Token usage:** The AI panel header shows token consumption. Agentic mode can pull significant data when comparing runs - watch your usage carefully. You generally get what you pay for, but I've tried to make the prompt engineering explicit enough to make "dumb" models "smart". For free usage, go local with Ollama - bring a big GPU.

**Privacy:** Your credentials and test data are only sent when you request analysis. Use local providers (Ollama/LM Studio) for complete privacy.

**Customization:** Edit AI behavior in `autoroam/tools/prompt_engineering.py`.

> [!NOTE]
> AI settings (API key, endpoint, model) are stored locally in `webui/server/ai_settings.json`. Your preferred interface is saved in `webui/server/user_prefs.json` - tell RoamBot once and it remembers.

### Example Prompts

**Running tests:**
- "Run a roam test on wlp0s20f3"
- "Test my network and save the results"
- "Run a test with RSSI threshold of -70"

**Analysis:**
- "What were the failures in this test?"
- "Why did roam #3 take so long?"
- "Are there any configuration issues with these APs?"

**Multi-run comparison:**
- "Compare the last two Wilson-Corp runs"
- "Show me all IoT tests from this week"
- "Has performance improved since yesterday?"
- "Which network has better roaming performance?"
- "What's the trend in association times?"

**Network audit:**
- "Are all my APs configured consistently?"
- "Which APs are overloaded?"
- "Do I have co-channel interference?"

### REST API
REST API for programmatic access. Swagger docs at https://localhost:8443/api/docs (handy button in the UI after login).

API calls require `X-API-Key` header with the key from `webui/server/api_key.txt`.
